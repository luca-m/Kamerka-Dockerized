### Powered by Shodan - Supported by Binary Edge & WhoisXMLAPI

## NSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across Operational Technologies and Control Systems

> Shodan, Kamerka, are creating a “perfect storm” of 
> 
> 1) easy access to unsecured assets, 
> 
> 2) use of common, open-source information about devices, and 
> 
> 3) an extensive list of exploits deployable via common exploit frameworks (e.g., Metasploit, Core Impact, and Immunity Canvas).

## Usage

#### 1. Scan for Internet facing Industrial Control Systems, Medical and Internet of Things devices based on country or coordinates.
#### 2. Gather passive intelligence from WHOISXML, BinaryEdge and Shodan or active by scanning target directly.
#### 3. Thanks to indicators from devices and google maps, pinpoit device to specific place or facility (hospital, wastewater treatment plant, gas station, university, etc.)
#### 4. (Optional, not recommended) 4. Guess/Bruteforce or use default password to gain access to the device. Some exploits are implemented for couple specific IoTs.
#### 5. Report devices in critical infrastructure to your local CERT.

## Features
- More than 100 ICS devices
- Gallery section shows every gathered screenshot in one place
- Interactive Google maps
- Google street view support
- Possibility to implement own exploits or scanning techiques
- Support for NMAP scan in xml format as an input
- Find the route and change location of device
- Statistics for each search
- Search Flick photos nearby your device
- Position for vessels is scraped from device directly, rather than IP based
- Some devices return hints or location in the response. It's parsed and displayed as an indicator that helps to geolocate device.

- "All results" checkbox means get all results from Shodan, if it's turned off - only first page (100) results will be downloaded.
- "Own database" checkbox does not work but shows that is possible to integrate your own geolocation database.

### Search for Internet of things in specific coordinates
Type your coordinates in format "lat,lon", hardcoded radius is 20km.
